In this assignment, i have created three classes in separate packages - Data, Singleton, and Main.

The variableClass class contained an int and a char member variable that were not initialized.
We added two methods, one to print these variables and another to print two local variables without initializing them.
I also created a constructor to initialize the member variables.

The MySingleton class contained a non-static String member variable.
I added a static method that takes a String as a parameter and initializes the member variable and returns the object of that class.
I also added a non-static method to print the String.

The Main class created objects of the variableClass and MySingleton classes and called their respective methods to print the values.
The Main class called the static method of the Singleton class to initialize the member variable and
then called the non-static method to print the String.

Overall, this assignment helped to understand the concept of default initialization in Java and the Singleton design pattern.
